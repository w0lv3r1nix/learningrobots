# My code for the project "Learning Robots" at Ulm University

Involves training an DQN-agent on a simulation and controlling a NAO-robot by loading the trained model. The code is mostly concerned with the custom simulation I wrote and the respective reinforcement learning paradigm. Call "python3 train.py \<network\>"  to start a training run.
